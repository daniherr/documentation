# Get Funded

Weâ€™re granting $5,000+, per-project, to develop software micro-engines with one mission: automated detection of malware in submissions to the PolySwarm marketplace. Malware can appear anywhere: files, URLs, or web pages, but you choose your focus.

Micro-engines can specialize in **specific families of malware or in identifying sketchy files in a narrow context** (think EvilPdfFlagger.exe).
Just be better than the status quo.
