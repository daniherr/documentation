<p>
    PolySwarm Alpha will deliver a minimum viable product (MVP) that implements an end-to-end Bounty workflow.
    The chief goal with Alpha is to allow Ambassadors and Experts to test transactions on a PolySwarm test network (“testnet”) to provide early feedback and bug reports.
</p>

<p>We anticipate that PolySwarm Alpha will deliver the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Bounty Manager: a collection of contracts for assessing threat via Bounties</li>
    <li>Artifact posting and retrieval to / from off-PolySwarm storage</li>
    <li>Prototype algorithm for Arbiter selection</li>
    <li>Reference implementations for Bounty publishing, Assertion response, and Arbiter ground truth determination</li>
</ul>
