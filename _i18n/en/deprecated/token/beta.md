 PolySwarm Beta will focus on delivering PolySwarm Offer support over Raiden-style Channels established directly between Ambassadors and Experts.
 Channel Open, Close and settlement will occur on the PolySwarm test network (“testnet”).
 We will seek bug reports and feedback on this new mechanism from early testers.

<p>We anticipate PolySwarm Beta will deliver the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Offer Channels
        <ul>
            <li>Distributed Channel Establishment</li>
            <li>Multiple offers via single channel</li>
            <li>NCT settlement at Channel Close</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Reference implementation for Offer production and response</li>
</ul>
