    PolySwarm’s future releases will mirror the evolving threat landscape and real-world usage of the network.
    We see several opportunities, contingent on observed PolySwarm usage, for the following features to benefit the network:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Flexible Artifact Confidentiality
        <ul>
            <li><u>Basic</u>: Artifacts selectively disclosed to Experts or SaaS providers</li>
            <li><u>Advanced</u>: Artifacts never revealed to anyone outside of SGX enclaves of fully homomorphic engines</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>New Instruments (e.g. subscription-ready threat feeds)</li>
    <li>Deployment support for endpoint-resident Worker containers that supplant today’s endpoint protection suites</li>
</ul>
