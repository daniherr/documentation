    PolySwarm Gamma will focus on providing matchmaking features that facilitate collaboration between Ambassadors, Experts, and Arbiters.
    Experts will be able to encapsulate their expertise into Workers tuned to specific types of Artifact. 
    We expect Experts to be able to advertise these Workers in a PolySwarm Registry.
    This Worker Registry should allow Ambassadors to engage with Workers in a risk-free manner prior to the Stable release (Gamma will continue to utilize the PolySwarm testnet).
</p>
<p>
    Additionally, this release will consider enhancing and extending the Bounty instrument in light of Alpha and Beta feedback and experience. 
    As one example, we anticipate that Bounties will benefit from the ability to solicit Assertions that are kept confidential from other Experts and revealed only after the Assertion deadline.
    Depending on the level of user interest at this phase, this is a feature we will either explore during Gamma or defer to a later milestone.
</p>

<p>We anticipate PolySwarm Gamma will deliver the following and be feature complete:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Worker Description Language (WDL) describing artifact analysis capabilities and Expert authorship attribution (for reputation)</li>
    <li>Distributed, searchable, registry of Workers and their capabilities.</li>
    <li>Confidentiality for pre-deadline Bounty Assertions</li>
    <li>Finalize Arbiter selection, response, and end-to-end Bounty feedback loop</li>
</ul>
