    PolySwarm’s second stable release currently will have two main goals: (1) expanding Offers and Bounties to handle a wider range of Artifact types (e.g. URLs and Network streams) and (2) easing Swarm utilization for the Enterprise and Home User.
</p>
<p>
    Artifact type expansion in future PolySwarm releases should make it possible to handle, for example, automated phishing detection by placing Bounties and Offers directly on URLs and hosted content.

    Extending PolySwarm’s protections directly to the endpoint will be a priority for post-Stable development.
    We anticipate developing an Open Source reference implementation of an Endpoint protection suite which automatically blocks malicious artifacts based on PolySwarm’s intelligence.
    We see this open agent framework as a key to widespread adoption.
