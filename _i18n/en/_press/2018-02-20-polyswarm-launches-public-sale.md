By introducing a platform  encouraging innovation and competition, the market will reward experts who are best able to protect users.

_“Support from early backers demonstrates great interest in what we’re building at PolySwarm, and we’re excited to engage the information security and blockchain communities through our public token sale,”_ said Steve Bassi, CEO at PolySwarm.

PolySwarm’s founders built the company out of Narf Industries, LLC, an information security firm that recently completed a blockchain-based identity management project for the Department of Homeland Security, as well as cutting-edge information security projects for DARPA.
