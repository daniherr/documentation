DC2 is a professional group for IT security companies aimed at developing best practices for blockchain-based cybersecurity.

“PolySwarm is thrilled to partner with Rivetz as co-founding members of the Decentralized Cybersecurity Consortium, and we are dedicated to advancing cybersecurity solutions and best practices at the intersection of InfoSec and blockchain,” said Paul Makowski, CTO and Co-Founder of PolySwarm. “We look forward to welcoming more outstanding projects to DC2, and advancing public discourse, policy, and solutions in this space.” 

“Cybersecurity needs to be built in by design, not added on as an afterthought. The tools and standards to assure the highest quality data on blockchain will be critical to growing the value of the entire market,” Rivetz CEO and co-founder Steven Sprague said. “We are excited to partner with PolySwam to co-found the Decentralized Cybersecurity Consortium to build a more secure future.”  

PolySwarm is the first decentralized marketplace for malware detection, a global community of anti-malware working together to best detect today’s threats. PolySwarm re-imagines the $8.5 billion per year threat intelligence market with crowdsourced, collaborative malware detection. It incentivizes specialized knowledge and mandates interoperability, allowing enterprises and end users alike to obtain more complete threat coverage.

Rivetz supports advanced security capabilities that provide owners of account enhanced protection, assuring integrity of messaging and applications. Its RvT cybersecurity token provides verifiable security controls for blockchain transactions. The RvT token enables multifactor authentication across devices, to achieve provable security at the transaction and authentication level.
