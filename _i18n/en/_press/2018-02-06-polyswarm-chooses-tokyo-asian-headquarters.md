**PUERTO RICO / TOKYO** -- Decentralized IT security marketplace [PolySwarm](https://polyswarm.io/) today announced its expansion in Asia with a new office opening in Tokyo, Japan. Today’s antivirus and IT security market is dominated by single vendor offerings that often miss emerging threats. PolySwarm incentivizes a global community of information security experts to disrupt the $8.5 billion cyber threat intelligence industry, providing enterprises and consumers with unprecedented speed and accuracy in threat detection. By introducing a platform that encourages innovation and competition, the market will reward experts who are best able to protect users. 

*“As we build the future of security, it’s important for PolySwarm to build a strong presence in Asian markets,”* said Steve Bassi, CEO and Founder of PolySwarm. *“We’re starting with Tokyo because of its access to potential cybersecurity partners and thriving blockchain industry. We look forward to growing the PolySwarm community in Japan and beyond.”* 

PolySwarm recently teamed up with mobile security solutions provider Rivetz to form the Decentralized Cybersecurity Consortium (DC2), a professional group for IT security companies aimed at developing best practices for blockchain-based cybersecurity. DC2 will welcome projects dedicated to advancing public discourse, policy, and solutions surrounding decentralized security solutions. 

PolySwarm’s founders built the company out of Narf Industries, LLC, an information security firm that recently completed a blockchain-based identity management project for the Department of Homeland Security, as well as cutting-edge information security projects for DARPA. PolySwarm’s advisory board includes former McAfee CIO Mark Tonnesen, alongside renowned information security experts Dan Guido, Chris Eagle, Dr. Sergey Bratus, and Carl Hoffman. 

The PolySwarm market runs on Nectar (“NCT”), an ERC20-compatible utility token that makes it easy to submit and classify potential threats on the PolySwarm market. Nectar replaces traditional, outdated antivirus and threat-scanning subscription payments. The Nectar token sale begins February 20, 2018.
