#### About PolySwarm

PolySwarm is the first decentralized marketplace where hackers build anti-malware engines that compete to protect you. Think Bitcoin, but instead of mining, a global community of anti-malware experts converge and work together to best detect today’s threats. In doing so, PolySwarm incentivizes rapid innovation in the $8.5B/yr cyber threat intelligence space with precise economic instruments that reward a global community of security experts for timely and accurate malware identification.

Today’s anti virus and cyber security market is dominated by single-vendor offerings which often miss emerging threats. PolySwarm brings enterprises, consumers, vendors and geographically-diverse security experts together into a single marketplace for more complete threat detection. Experts craft and maintain competing software “micro-engines” that quickly identify the latest threats, attempting to outperform their competition. PolySwarm’s “Proof of Work” is threat detection accuracy: the market rewards experts who are best able to defend enterprises and end users.

PolySwarm is developed by PolySwarm Pte. Ltd. with funding derived from the sale of ERC20-compatible PolySwarm Nectar (“NCT”) utility tokens. Our team brings decades of cyber security expertise to PolySwarm and has been deeply involved prototyping smart contract and deep cyber security solutions for the likes of DHS and DARPA.
