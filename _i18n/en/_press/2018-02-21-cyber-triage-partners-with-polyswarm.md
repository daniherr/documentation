**BOSTON, MA / SAN JUAN, PUERTO RICO - FEBRUARY 21, 2018 -**  Decentralized IT security marketplace [PolySwarm](https://polyswarm.io/) today announced that Basis Technology will support its decentralized cybersecurity marketplace with Cyber Triage, the automated, agentless, endpoint investigation tool. Cyber Triage’s [upcoming release](https://cybertriage.com/) will enable automatic querying of the PolySwarm network for deeper analysis, building on top of Cyber Triage’s existing cloud-based malware detection. PolySwarm is the first decentralized marketplace where security experts build anti-malware engines that compete to protect enterprises and end users.

_“Cyber Triage endpoint investigations reveal suspicious files, but confirming these files’ malintent is often a manual process,”_ said Carl Hoffman, CEO of Basis Technology, the company behind Cyber Triage. _“With PolySwarm integration, Cyber Triage response teams can optimize their process by rapidly gathering opinions and advanced analysis about suspicious files from a network of cybersecurity experts.”_

_“Cyber Triage + PolySwarm will deliver more rapid and thorough threat detection during time-sensitive security incident response. Allowing responders to query PolySwarm’s distributed network to investigate suspicious files for malware will enable incident responders to focus on kicking attackers out - and keeping them out,”_ said Steve Bassi, CEO of PolySwarm. 
 
The PolySwarm market runs on Nectar (“NCT”), an ERC20-compatible utility token that makes it easy to submit and classify potential threats on the PolySwarm market. Nectar replaces traditional, outdated antivirus and threat-scanning subscription payments. The Nectar token sale began February 20, 2018.
