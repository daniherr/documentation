Through this partnership, PolySwarm will support the development of Binary Ninja, whose world class analysis capabilities will be provided to security experts in the PolySwarm ecosystem.

*“This partnership ensures PolySwarm will have a vested interest in helping Binary Ninja become the world’s most valuable and advanced reverse engineering platform,”* said Jordan Wiens, co-founder of Vector 35.

*“We’re excited to be working with Vector 35 to bring Binary Ninja into the PolySwarm ecosystem. This partnership will allow us to offer security experts a more powerful toolset so they can spend more time analyzing malware and protecting users,”* said Steve Bassi, CEO of PolySwarm.

As part of PolySwarm’s [Malware Bounty Program](https://polyswarm.io/security_experts/index.html) that rewards security experts in Nectar tokens for uploading malware samples, 100 Binary Ninja student licences will be given away to the first 100 security experts who earn 5,000 tokens.

Today’s antivirus and IT security market is dominated by single-vendor offerings that often miss emerging threats. PolySwarm incentivizes a global community of information security experts to disrupt the $8.5 billion cyber threat intelligence industry, providing enterprises and consumers with unprecedented speed and accuracy in threat detection. By introducing a platform  encouraging innovation and competition, the market will reward experts who are best able to protect users.

PolySwarm’s founders built the company out of Narf Industries, LLC, an information security firm that recently completed a blockchain-based identity management project for the Department of Homeland Security as well as cutting-edge information security projects for DARPA. PolySwarm’s advisory board includes former McAfee CIO Mark Tonnesen, alongside renowned information security and blockchain experts Dan Guido, Chris Eagle, Dr. Sergey Bratus, and Carl Hoffman.

The PolySwarm market runs on Nectar (“NCT”), an ERC20-compatible utility token that makes it easy to submit and classify potential threats on the PolySwarm market. Nectar replaces traditional, outdated antivirus and threat-scanning subscription payments. The [Nectar token sale](https://tokensale.polyswarm.io/) begins February 20, 2018.
