**BOSTON, MA /SAN JUAN, PUERTO RICO - FEBRUARY 26, 2018 -**  Decentralized IT security marketplace [PolySwarm](https://polyswarm.io/) today announced a partnership with the lead development team behind [Cuckoo Sandbox](https://cuckoosandbox.org/). Cuckoo Sandbox is the leading open-source automated malware analysis system, and is used daily by thousands of malware analysts, SOC & CERT employees, and threat intelligence teams. PolySwarm’s partnership with Bremer Computer Security B.V., the Enterprise supplier of Cuckoo, will produce PolySwarm’s first Arbiter, kickstarting PolySwarm’s roadmap for early adoption.

_“In today's world, with more and more advanced malware being released on a daily basis, it’s becoming increasingly difficult to perform detection and understanding of the motives of attackers in near real-time,”_ said Jurriaan Bremer, Lead Developer of Cuckoo Sandbox. _“We believe the PolySwarm ecosystem is capable of achieving this exact goal through the ‘many eyes’ principle of the network, and we look forward to collaborating to improve malware detection.”_

_“Cuckoo Sandbox takes an innovative, dynamic approach to malware detection. We’re thrilled to have Jurriaan’s team on board as PolySwarm’s first Arbiter,”_ said Steve Bassi, CEO of PolySwarm. _“Partnerships with marquee teams such as Jurriaan’s are crucial to PolySwarm’s disruption of the threat intelligence ecosystem.”_

Today’s antivirus and IT security market is dominated by single-vendor offerings that often miss emerging threats. PolySwarm incentivizes a global community of information security experts to disrupt the $8.5 billion cyber threat intelligence industry, providing enterprises and consumers with unprecedented speed and accuracy in threat detection. By introducing a platform encouraging innovation and competition, the market will reward experts who are best able to protect users.

PolySwarm’s founders built the company out of Narf Industries, LLC, an information security firm that recently completed a blockchain-based identity management project for the Department of Homeland Security as well as cutting-edge information security projects for DARPA. PolySwarm’s advisory board includes former McAfee CIO Mark Tonnesen, alongside renowned information security and blockchain experts Dan Guido, Chris Eagle, Dr. Sergey Bratus, and Carl Hoffman.

The PolySwarm market runs on Nectar (“NCT”), an ERC20-compatible utility token that makes it easy to submit and classify potential threats on the PolySwarm market. Nectar replaces traditional, outdated antivirus and threat-scanning subscription payments. The Nectar token sale begins February 20, 2018.
