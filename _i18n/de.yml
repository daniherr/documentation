    intro: PolySwarm is the first decentralized marketplace where security experts earn income by operating cutting-edge micro-engines that compete to protect users and enterprises.
    problemstitle: Problems Solved by PolySwarm
    problems:
      - title: Unbalanced Market
        description: While the costs associated with cybercrime are expected to double in 2021, experts estimate that there will be a shortage of 3.5 million IT security jobs by 2021…Most of the security jobs are in western countries, while there is lack of opportunities in other locations.
      - title: Access to opportunities
        description: PolySwarm’s decentralized marketplace breaks down geographical barriers connecting expertise with opportunity. PolySwarm addresses the problem on both ends, allowing talented security expertise to freely flow from regions without enough jobs to regions without enough talent.
      - title: Niche software is hard to scale
        description: It is hard to find buyers for narrowly-scoped, specialized security software solutions that security experts currently develop and use in their local threat analysis environments.
      - title: Revenue stream
        description: Polyswarm provides security experts an outlet to monetize their already built specialized anti-malware software. They can also build their own with using PolySwarm’s platform development kit (Perigord).  Experts compete to detect today’s threats and are rewarded based on accuracy and speed of their assertions.

    bountytitle: Free Nectar for Malware Bounty Program.
    bountyannounce: $300,000 worth of NCT up for grabs. Enter the bounty to claim your share.
    bountycontent: >-
      PolySwarm’s free nectar for malware campaign was launched January 23, 2018 and continues until the funding cap is reached.

      <br /><br />

      We will cap the value of the campaign at $300,000 with a maximum of $6,250 to be awarded each day.

      <br /><br />

      Security Experts can earn NCT while testing out the marketplace on the testnet.
      Once per day, each Security Expert can enter one IPFS link to a suspicious file. If you are one of the first five to trigger a ClamAV signature per malware family, you earn NCT.
      Each day, we will announce a specific malware family in the <a href="https://t.me/polyswarm" target="_blank">PolySwarm Telegram Channel</a>, and if the user submits a file that triggers a ClamAV signature for that malware family, they will get an additional NCT bonus.

    title: FAQ
    faqs:
      - question: How do I purchase Nectar tokens (NCT)?
        answer: |
          Nectar tokens (NCT) will be available for purchase exclusively with Ether (ETH).
          If you plan to participate in the Nectar token sale, we recommend acquiring ETH well in advance of the sale start date to ensure your ability to contribute.

          <br /><br />

          Participants will complete a brief registration process that will be launching in advance of the token sale.

          <br /><br />

        dn: how-purchase
      - question: What are PolySwarm's minimum and maximum funding levels?
        answer: |
          A lot of work goes into the creation of a viable marketplace - well beyond the engineering work of developing smart contracts and reference implementations.
          In order for PolySwarm to be a success, substantial community engagement must take place to ensure a sufficiently thick market in terms of Enterprises, Ambassadors and Experts.
          See funding level tranches for a rough breakdown of categories of costs inherent to bootstrapping the PolySwarm Market.

          <br /><br />

          PolySwarm's minimum funding level is set at <b>$5,000,000 USD equivalent in ETH</b>.
          PolySwarm's maximum funding level (cap) is set at <b>$50,000,000 USD equivalent in ETH</b>.
          For the purpose of minimum funding calculation, the exchange rate as specified on <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/" target="_blank">https://coinmarketcap.com/</a> at the beginning of the Creation Period (February 20, 2018 at 19:00 UTC) will be used.
        dn: what-is-min-funding
      - question: What happens if PolySwarm's minimum funding level is not reached?
        answer: |
          If PolySwarm does not meet its minimum funding level, all ETH contributions will be refunded to the contributors' addresses.
        dn: nomin
      - question: How many Nectar tokens will be created? Will more be created later?
        answer: |
          The amount of Nectar created will be determined by the total ETH contributed during the token sale.
          Please refer to PolySwarm's Terms of Token Sale document for exchange rates between ETH and NCT during different tranches.

          <br /><br />

          <b>After the token sale closes, no more NCT will be created</b>.
        dn: how-many
      - question: When does the sale start? How long is the sale open?
        answer: |
          The token sale opens on February 20th, 2018 19:00 UTC and will close on March 22nd, 2018 19:00 UTC
        dn: when-start
      - question: How is PolySwarm Pte. Ltd. ensuring the security of the token sale contracts and subsequently funded PolySwarm contracts?
        answer: |
          We're glad you asked!
          We're security people ourselves, so this would be one of the first questions we would ask if we were in your shoes.

          <br /><br />

          At a high level, we will take the following precautions:

          <br /><br />

          1. Nectar's token sale contract will be very simple and will draw heavily from well-studied <a href="https://github.com/ConsenSys/Tokens" target="_blank">ConsenSys</a> and <a href="https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/zeppelin-solidity/tree/master/contracts" target="_blank">OpenZeppelin</a> contracts.
            No reinventing the wheel here.

            <br />

          2. PolySwarm Pte. Ltd. will run a bug bounty program to crowdsource vulnerability identification in contracts developed with token sale funding.

          <br />

          3. PolySwarm Pte. Ltd. will engage with Trail of Bits for a professional audit using cutting-edge EVM tools.

          <br /><br />

          The two latter items deserve more discussion; head over to <a href="/security" target="_blank">our Security page</a> to learn more!
        dn: security
      - question: Do Nectar token holders participate in PolySwarm governance?
        answer: |
          The PolySwarm Market is a market and specifically does not function like a Distributed Autonomous Organization (DAO).
          PolySwarm's Nectar tokens are designed to be purely utilitarian: participants exchange threat intelligence for NCT - end of story.

          <br /><br />

          <b>PolySwarm token holders (and PolySwarm Pte. Ltd.) will not earn any manner of dividends or "return" for Nectar holdings, nor are PolySwarm token holders entitled to any equity, voting rights, or any other right beyond NCT's utility for engaging in PolySwarm Market transactions.</b>
          Fees are not remitted to holders (including PolySwarm Pte. Ltd..

          <br /><br />

          PolySwarm is specifically designed to <i>avoid</i> token holder control over the market, as this would be anathema to PolySwarm's goals for fostering an open, fair and distributed marketplace for threat intelligence.
        dn: governance
      - question: Why does PolySwarm need a token?
        answer: |
          Nectar serves to isolate PolySwarm from external market forces including the value of Ether (ETH) and the performance of applications that transact in Ether.

          <br /><br />

          Token-enabled market isolation is not a uniquely PolySwarm concern; many other applications have chosen to use tokens for the same reason.
          Nectar-based isolation will allow for more consistency in PolySwarm market behavior, enabling participants to transact with greater confidence and reducing perverse incentives that would otherwise harm the PolySwarm Market.

          <br /><br />

          Suppose PolySwarm participants transacted directly in Ether (ETH).
          In a hypthotical Ether-based PolySwarm, Ambassadors are incentivized to buffer a number of Enterprises' artifacts until the value of Ether diminishes sufficiently to minimize the Ambassador's Bounty placement cost and in turn maximize his / her profit.
          This selfish behavior might be good for the Ambassador in the short term, but triggers a tragedy of commons condition in the long term, potentially causing gridlocks via delayed Bounties (or even delayed Assertions placed on Bounties).
          When considering the ground truth feedback mechanism, we expect PolySwarm bounties to operate on day or week timescales: orders of magnitude longer than minute fluctuations in ETH value.

          <br /><br />

          In a Nectar-based PolySwarm, we are able to peg the price of Bounty placement (in terms of NCT required) <i>independently</i> of ETH value fluctuations, unlocking stability strategies and diminishing return on micro timing choices that would otherwise amount to perverse incentive.
        dn: why-token
      - question: >-
          How do I complete the KYC (Know Your Customer) to get prepared for the
          token sale prior to Feb 20th?
        answer: |
          We will have series of KYC questions that have to be answered when you register for the token
          sale. This should be ready around 15 Jan 2018.
        dn: howto-kyc
      - question: >-
          How would you prevent a rogue team of say 100-200 hackers, who are
          sponsored and don’t care about losing money, from building up their reputation as
          trustworthy experts over a lengthy period of time, say a year or two, and who may then
          become trusted by a large firm for example, only to want to flip on them after a while
          and suggest that certain malware that this firm might be asking about is in fact
          harmless, when in reality it isn’t?
        answer: |
          If it takes 100-200 well financed hackers to build reputation over time and ultimately risk burning
          that reputation to hide some malware from a subset of ambassadors, I'd say we've won. That
          bar is far higher than today's status quo - this is a much more costly endeavor that what is
          required to evade AV today.

          <br /><br />

          No system can be 100% perfect, including PolySwarm, but PolySwarm is far better than today's
          environment if such resources are required to pull off such an attack.
        dn: rogue-protect
      - question: >-
          As a single user at home, how exactly would PolySwarm help me? I mean if
          I didn’t want to go through a known anti-virus company, like AVAST or any of the other
          scores of firms out there, how would I tap into the PolySwarm network on my PC?
        answer: |
          End users will benefit from PolySwarm by being exposed to better-valued services. We don't
          expect most end users to directly interact with the PolySwarm network; this is the role that
          Ambassadors fill.

          <br /><br />

          PolySwarm Ambassadors will be today's familiar, existing AV companies (like AVAST) as well
          as new companies made possible by PolySwarm’s economic model.

          <br /><br />

          We expect to see new companies acting as Ambassadors that serve as a direct conduit to the
          PolySwarm network. These new companies will exchange end user subscription fees for a
          convenient link to the PolySwarm network, handling Bounties and Offers on behalf of their end
          user customers. This new type of company will almost certainly have lower cost relative to
          monolithic offerings seen today. We believe this will translate into a better value for the end
          user.

          <br /><br />

          In short: most end users will continue to engage with a subscription-based service, but will get
          more protection for less money due to the efficiencies made possible by PolySwarm's
          crowdsourced, distributed design.
        dn: home-use-connect
      - question: >-
          What strategies are PolySwarm planning to use to bootstrap the various
          actors/services required for the network to function effectively from day one?
        answer: |
          We have a multi-pronged approach, targeting enterprise, ambassador and security expert
          onboarding, respectively.

          <br /><br />

          At a high level, we will foster a network effect, playing enterprise interest toward security experts
          (more bounties available) and then security expert interest toward ambassadors and enterprises
          (increasingly quality threat intelligence). This two-sided effect will naturally encourage uptake on
          the opposite side.

          <br /><br />

          <b>1. Sponsor PolySwarm integration into existing incident response (IR) and defensive
          toolkits.</b>

          <br /><br />

          PolySwarm will offer Nectar bounties (from PolySwarm Pte. Ltd.s holding) as reward for
          open source contributions to widely used IR, defense and forensics toolkits. Specifically, we will
          target open source projects like Facebook’s <a href="https://osquery.io/" target="_blank">osquery</a> , and
          <a href="https://www.sleuthkit.org/" target="_blank">The Sleuth Kit / Autopsy</a>.
          By making it trivial to use PolySwarm with these tools, PolySwarm seamlessly plugs into
          existing workflows. Some users will choose to leverage PolySwarm and any such leverage will
          help create a network effect.

          <br /><br />

          <b>2. Partnership with existing threat intelligence vendors, offering early Arbitership as
          incentive to plug into the network.</b>

          <br /><br />

          Existing threat intelligence companies will desire to become Arbiters in the PolySwarm
          ecosystem. PolySwarm will offer designated arbitership to chosen Arbiters to help bootstrap the
          network. This will be limited time offer, after which Arbiter must maintain high ecosystem
          throughput to maintain their status.

          <br /><br />

          <b>3. Hackathons, competitions and sponsorship directed toward information security
          expertise, with an emphasis toward markets that already participate heavily in
          vulnerability bug bounty programs.</b>

          <br /><br />

          This one is pretty self-explanatory. We will target information security conferences in Eastern
          Europe, Asia, Latin and South America in particular.
        dn: bootstrap-roles
      - question: >-
          What gives Swarm the confidence that they will be able to attract thousands
          of Experts to become part of the network?
        answer: |
          This was alluded to a little in the previous question / response.

          <br /><br />

          In addition to the response above, PolySwarm plans to host a Nectar-for-artifact bounty program
          to help build a corpus of “swarmed” artifacts in the network and get initial people onboard.
          Security experts will receive Nectar in response to “swarming” malicious artifacts during this
          Beta period. Prior to Arbiter establishment, malintent determination will be outsourced.

          <br /><br />

          Beyond this mass market approach, all of the founders and many of our friends and colleagues
          work in the Information Security industry. Many of them have custom malware analysis tools
          that they develop for their work or hobbies that could be reconfigured to work as micro-engines.

          <br /><br />

          We speak with graduate and PhD students at conferences and events that have the technical
          skills to build and run micro-engines, but cannot get jobs at cyber security companies due to
          their nationality or choice of home location.

          <br /><br />

          The quality security experts are out there, and we are giving them the means to participate.

      - question: >-
          Is the Hacken project a competitor of PolySwarm? How are they
          similar/different? Why would a Security Expert want to be involved with PolySwarm vs
          Hacken?
        answer: |
          It’s a different market and we wish them success. Hacken is decentralizing bug (vulnerability)
          bounties against corporate sites and software, basically security experts doing manual analysis
          against unique targets.

          <br /><br />

          We’re pretty familiar with the bug bounty market: average transaction value is 400-500 USD per
          bounty. Hacken’s market requires manual review to evaluate if bounties are won or not. There’s
          probably on the order of 1000’s of transactions a year.

          <br /><br />

          Conversely, PolySwarm deals with the sort of threat intelligence that can be <b>automated</b>, such
          as anti-virus. Anti-virus companies, worldwide, see billions of samples a day and probably 10’s
          of millions are unique. Transaction value ranges 0.0025-0.015 USD per file/url/artifact scan. All
          micro-engines and the vast majority of ground truth determination in PolySwarm will be
          automated.

          <br /><br />

          Manual review of a smallish binary takes the better part of a day or two. Larger applications, we
          are talking many days or even weeks.

      - question: >-
          Does Polyswarm protect a company's corporate network similar to how a
          Palo Alto Networks device does?
        answer: |
          PolySwarm will enable companies like Palo Alto to enhance their offerings by being able to
          solicit crowdsourced opinion on files they're unsure of. Today, they reach out to VirusTotal (and
          pay handsomely to do so). Tomorrow, with PolySwarm, they'll get access to a broader set of
          security expertise without a middle man (VirusTotal is owned by Google).

          <br /><br />

          From the enterprise perspective, should Palo Alto plug into PolySwarm, the enterprise will see
          better detection rates. Palo Alto will save money and ideally those savings will be passed down
          to the customer. In the PolySwarm ecosystem, Palo Alto (PA) is an "Ambassador".
        dn: poly-palo
      - question: Is PolySwarm a Marketplace?
        answer: |
          Yes. More specifically, it's a set of smart contracts that define how threat intelligence is sourced
          and how good threat intelligence is rewarded at the expense of bad (inaccurate) threat
          intelligence.

          <br /><br />

          We expect some larger enterprises to participate directly in the marketplace (bypassing
          Ambassadors) and one of our big goals is make Ambassadorship as accessible as possible --
          today you need funding rounds, marketing, HR, etc, etc, to build a company like Palo Alto
          Networks. Tomorrow, we hope that the raw statistics surrounding each Ambassadors’
          performance, coupled with the autonomous nature of the market will allow for more streamlined
          operations - mini-Ambassadors if you will - that wouldn't fit into today's market, but would thrive
          in PolySwarm.

          <br /><br />

          In other words, only few can get listed as a vendor on VirusTotal, but anyone can call
          themselves an Ambassador on PolySwarm. Ambassadors will have to maintain their quality of
          service and reputation to attract enterprises and end users as customers.
