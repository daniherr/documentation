# PolySwarm Documentation

Docs is a comprehensive documentation hub for public to help Experts/Arbiters/Ambassadors/ etc.. 
to know/get help from Polyswarm products.

## Branch Level

### master

The pages here is regarded as public/authentic. Not any articles under development or incomplete state
should be located here.

### develop

This branch is pre-master branch which enhances development-phase articles. Once the branch is ready 
for release, it will be merged into master

## Adding and Localizing Content

Create a file in `public-src/_docs`.
The content of that file should look something like this:

`public-src/_docs/example.md`
```markdown
---
title: docs.example.title
---

{% tf _docs/example.md %}
```

The section between the `---` dividers is the frontmatter.
The frontmatter contains `name: value` pairs, where the value is defined in the `en.yml` file.

Everything below the second `---`, should just refer to one or more markdown files found in the `_i18n` directory.

You should then have a `en.yml` file and a `en/_docs/example.md` file, like this:

`_i18n/en.yml`
```yml
docs:
  example:
    title: My Example Page
```

`_i18n/en/_docs/example.md`
```markdown
## Example

This is my example markdown file.
```

Now, visiting `/example` will display "This is my example markdown file." in the body and have a title of "My example page".

English content is the basis for all other languages, so once you've created the English content, it can be translated following our instructions below.

### Images

Images should be placed in `public-src/images` and referenced as `/public-src/images/example.png`.

Images should no more than about 720px wide and should be optimized before they are uploaded, using a tool like [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/).

### Translation

Initial content is all created in English.
We use [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com) to manage translation.
Non-English files are automatically generated by Crowdin, so it is best not to edit non-English files directly.
If you want to help translate the PolySwarm documentation, please [sign-up as a Crowdin translator](https://crwd.in/polyswarm-documentation) for our project.
If you want to translate this documentation into a language that our Crowdin project is not configured for, let us know, we can add more languages.


## Navigation

Navigation items can be edited in the `[lang].yml` file.

Add `root: true` to an item if you do not want the url to be localized.

Add `rooturl: true` to an item if you want to use https://polyswarm.io as the domain.

You can also add `subitems: (name: string, [array of items])` to create a dropdown.

## Headings and Sidebar Navigation

The sidebar navigation is generated automatically from the Level 2 (h2) and Level 3 (h3) headings on the page.

```markdown
  ## Main section

  ### Subsection
```

Level 1 (h1) headings should not be used as an h1 is already used in the header.

## Special Markdown Cases

### Callouts

Callouts are text boxes which are used to emphasize important content.

```html
<div class="m-callout m-callout--info">
  <p><strong>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet</strong></p>
  <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.</p>
  <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.</p>
</div>
```

Style Classes:
* `m-callout` - Grey
* `m-callout m-callout--info` - Purple
* `m-callout m-callout--warning` - Yellow
* `m-callout m-callout--danger` - Red
* `m-callout m-callout--success` - Green

### Flags

Flags are also text boxes which are used to emphasize important content, but are stylistically different.

```html
<div class="m-flag m-flag--danger">
  <p><strong>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet</strong></p>
  <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.</p>
  <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.</p>
</div>
```

Style Classes:
* `m-flag` - Purple
* `m-flag m-flag--warning` - Yellow
* `m-flag m-flag--danger` - Red
* `m-flag m-flag--success` - Green

### Videos

When embedding a YouTube video, it is best to wrap the embed code in a video wrapper using a div with the class of `h-video-wrapper` to make for a responsive embed.

```html
<div class="h-video-wrapper">
  <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dQw4w9WgXcQ?showinfo=0&rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>
```
